The Anti-Syndicate Reporting and Alert System is a software engineering project developed by a group of students from the Department of Computer Science at the American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB). The project aims to address the issue of illegal fee collections and extortion faced by shop owners in Bangladesh, particularly in local markets. The system provides a platform for shop owners and customers to report such incidents in real-time, while also enabling authorities to respond quickly and efficiently.

**Project Overview:**
In Bangladesh, many shop owners face extortion and illegal fee collections by syndicate members, creating an unsafe and unfair business environment. Traditional reporting methods, such as visiting police stations, are often slow and ineffective, leading to many incidents going unreported. This project proposes a mobile and web-based application that allows shop owners to report illegal activities directly to security personnel and police, while also enabling customers to verify government-set prices for products and report overpricing.
