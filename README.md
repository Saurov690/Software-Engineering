In Bangladesh, many shop owners face extortion and illegal fee collections by syndicate members, creating an unsafe and unfair business environment. Traditional reporting methods, such as visiting police stations, are often slow and ineffective, leading to many incidents going unreported. This project proposes a mobile and web-based application that allows shop owners to report illegal activities directly to security personnel and police, while also enabling customers to verify government-set prices for products and report overpricing.
